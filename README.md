## Power-BI-Project-1

Hereâ€™s a combined description for your Power BI dashboard:

Developed an interactive Power BI Dashboard to analyze and visualize key business metrics, providing actionable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboard highlights the Top/Bottom 5 products by sales, profit, and quantity sold, enabling quick identification of best and underperforming items. It showcases sales trends over time (daily, monthly, quarterly, annually) with dynamic visuals to track patterns and seasonality. The relationship between sales and profit is depicted using scatterplots for better understanding of profitability drivers.

The dashboard includes a feature to compare sales, profit, and quantity sold between two user-selected time periods, offering flexibility in trend analysis. It also calculates the average discount offered across various discount categories and presents the total number of orders placed. Detailed reports display Sales, Profit, Discount, Net Sales, and other fields for each order, with filtering options by Product, Date, Customer ID, Promotion Categories, and more. Additionally, city-wise sales distribution provides geographical insights for better regional targeting.

This dashboard empowers stakeholders with real-time, data-driven insights to make informed business decisions.
